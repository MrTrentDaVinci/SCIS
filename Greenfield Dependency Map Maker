# TOON File: `Greenfield Internal Dependency Maker`

**Purpose:**
Generate the **Program Internal Dependency Map (`A1p1s1f0.toon`)** for a new project using SCIS Phase 0 information.

---

## **Inputs (to be provided by the user)**

1. **`A1p0s0f0.md` – Greenfield Start / Program Summary**

   * Contains high-level program information, goals, and phase guidance.

2. **`A1p0s0f1.md` – Flat File Map**

   * Lists all sections, files, and their intended purpose.

3. **`A1p0s0f4.toon` – Component Map**

   * Lists all program components, their IDs, and relationships within sections.

4. **`A1p0s0f5.toon` – Non-Component Map**

   * Lists all helpers, utilities, and scripts relevant to the program.

---

## **Output**

* **`A1p1s1f0.toon` – Program Internal Dependency Map**

  * Each component and non-component mapped to its dependencies.
  * Section-to-section and intra-program relationships clearly defined.
  * Unique IDs for each entity to allow deterministic referencing.
  * Inter-program dependencies are flagged (if multiple programs exist in the folder).

---

## **LLM Instructions**

1. **Read Inputs:**

   * Parse the user-provided `f0` and `f1` to understand the program structure.
   * Use `f4` and `f5` to identify all components and non-components.

2. **Dependency Mapping:**

   * For each component:

     * List all components and non-components it depends on.
     * Include MCP endpoints if relevant.
   * For non-components:

     * List any components or other non-components they assist.
   * Maintain section boundaries (dependencies should indicate source and target sections).

3. **Normalization & Deduplication:**

   * Ensure each dependency is listed once.
   * Assign consistent unique IDs for deterministic generation.

4. **Formatting:**

   * Output should be a `.toon` file, following SCIS Phase 1 conventions.
   * Include a header referencing the inputs used (`f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f5`).
   * Provide a brief note section describing any assumptions made during dependency mapping.

---

## **Usage Notes**

* Only **Phase 0 files (`f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f5`)** are required.
* Dependencies must reflect the program **as currently designed**; this file does not predict future additions.
* Can be re-run anytime new components/non-components are added to the program.
