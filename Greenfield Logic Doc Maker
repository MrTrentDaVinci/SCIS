# TOON File: `Greenfield Logic Doc Maker`

**Purpose:**
Generate the **Logic Map Explainer (`A1p0s0f8.md`)** and the **Logic Determinization Map (`A1p0s0f9.toon`)** for a new SCIS project using Phase 0 files.

---

## **Inputs (to be provided by the user)**

1. **`A1p0s0f0.md` – Greenfield Start / Program Summary**

   * Contains high-level program objectives, phase guidance, and usage instructions.

2. **`A1p0s0f1.md` – Flat File Map**

   * Lists all sections, files, and their intended purposes.

3. **`A1p0s0f4.toon` – Component Map**

   * Lists all program components and their IDs.

4. **`A1p0s0f5.toon` – Non-Component Map**

   * Lists helpers, utilities, and scripts.

5. **`A1p1s1f0.toon` – Program Internal Dependency Map**

   * Details dependencies between components and non-components.

---

## **Outputs**

1. **`A1p0s0f8.md` – Logic Map Explainer**

   * Human-readable description of program logic across sections and components.
   * Notes guidance for AI on logical flow and operational rules.
   * Highlights critical paths and inter-component interactions.

2. **`A1p0s0f9.toon` – Logic Determinization Map**

   * Machine-readable map representing deterministic logical flow.
   * Encodes sequence, dependencies, and conditions for program execution.
   * Supports automated validation and future updates.

---

## **LLM Instructions**

1. **Read Inputs:**

   * Parse `f0` for program goals and constraints.
   * Use `f1` to understand the structure of sections and files.
   * Use `f4` and `f5` to identify all components and non-components.
   * Use `f0` and `f1` to establish contextual understanding.
   * Use `A1p1s1f0.toon` to understand internal dependencies.

2. **Logic Mapping:**

   * For each component, list its operational logic in sequence.
   * Capture how components interact with non-components.
   * Identify loops, conditional paths, and sequence dependencies.

3. **Determinization:**

   * Convert logical flow into a machine-readable format (`.toon`).
   * Use unique IDs for components, non-components, and sections.
   * Ensure deterministic paths and clearly mark optional or conditional flows.

4. **Documentation:**

   * Summarize logic flow in `A1p0s0f8.md` with clear, human-readable explanations.
   * Include references to sections, files, and dependencies.
   * Provide notes for AI on how to extend or modify logic safely in the future.

---

## **Usage Notes**

* Only **Phase 0 and Phase 1 internal dependency files** are required.
* Can be re-run if components, non-components, or dependencies are updated.
* Ensures AI-generated files follow deterministic execution rules.
