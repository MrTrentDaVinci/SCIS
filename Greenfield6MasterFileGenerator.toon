# Greenfield6MasterFileGenerator.toon - Greenfield Master File Generator Template

**Purpose**: Serves as the authoritative support template and master instruction set for LLMs to generate all remaining files in a new greenfield SCIS program. Uses minimal inputs (Program Summary, File Map, Component/Non-Component Registries) to deterministically produce maps, NCCF, logic, dependencies, and later-phase files.

# TOON File: `Greenfield Master File Generator`

**Purpose:**
Generate **all remaining A#p# SCIS files** for a new Greenfield project using minimal input: the initial Stage 0 files (Program Summary and File Map) plus Component/Non-Component Registries and any prior logic outputs.

---

## **Inputs (User-provided)**

1. `A#p0s0f0.md` – Greenfield Start / Program Summary
2. `A#p0s0f1.md` – File Map
3. `A#p0s0f3.toon` – Component Registry (or equivalent)
4. `A#p0s0f8.toon` – Non-Component Registry (if needed)
5. *(Optional)* Legacy Mapping (for brownfield elements)
6. *(Optional)* Pre-generated Logic Map (A#p0s0f5.md)

---

## **Outputs**

This TOON file can guide generation of any of the following:

### **Stage 0 – Maps, NCCF, Logic, Metrics**

* `A#p0s0f2.md` – Sub-Maps / Section Breakdown
* `A#p0s0f4.md` – NCCF (Non-Code Contract Framework)
* `A#p0s0f5.md` – Logic Map
* `A#p0s0f6.md` – Dependency Map
* `A#p0s0f7.md` – Metrics Map
* `A#p0s0f9.md` – Program-Specific Header Template (if needed)

### **Stage 1 – Dependencies & Analysis**

* `A#p1s1f0.toon` – Internal Dependency Map
* `A#p1s1f1.toon` – Section-to-Section Dependency Map
* `A#p1s1f2.toon` – Legacy or Cross-Program Mapping

### **Stage 2 – Core Implementation**

* `A#p2s0f0.py` – Core Code / Backend Scripts
* `A#p2s0f1.json/toon` – Component-Specific Contracts or Registries

### **Stage 3 – Integration / External**

* `A#p3s0f0.py` – MCP / API Handlers
* `A#p3s0f1.md` – Integration Notes

### **Stage 4 – Testing & Safety**

* `A#p4s0f0.md` – Testing Plan
* `A#p4s0f1.py` – Safe Execution / Test Wrappers

### **Documentation / Glossary**

* `A#p9s0f0.md` – Program Glossary & Definitions
* `A#p9s0f1.md` – Overall Documentation

## **LLM Instructions**

1. **Read Inputs:**

   * Load Program Summary and File Map for purpose and structure.
   * Load Component/Non-Component Registries for complete inventories.
   * Optional: Load any pre-generated logic or legacy maps.

2. **Determine Structure & Contracts:**

   * Derive dependencies, logic flows, and metric obligations from inputs.
   * Ensure alignment with NCCF and prior declarations.

3. **Generate Files in Order:**

   * Complete Stage 0 first → Stage 1 → Implementation → Testing → Documentation
   * Include full SCIS headers on every generated file.
   * Use stable IDs and cross-references.

4. **Validation:**

   * Cross-check against File Map for completeness.
   * Flag inconsistencies or missing metric obligations for review.
   * Recommend post-generation validation with tools.

---

## **Usage Notes**

* This TOON file serves as a **single master instruction set** for an LLM.
* Generate **one file at a time** or in batches, using the same inputs.
* Supports **iterative re-runs** after updates or extensions.
* Ensures deterministic, map-first generation with full observability.
