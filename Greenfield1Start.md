## Title: **SCIS Greenfield Start**

**Phase:** P0
**Scope:** New Program (Greenfield)
**Status:** Authoritative Entry Point

---

## 1. Program Overview

This file marks the formal start of a new program developed using the SCIS framework.
The program is being designed from a greenfield state, meaning no existing code, architecture, or implementation is assumed.

All subsequent files, structures, and implementation decisions must derive from the intent and constraints declared here.
No code, components, logic, or dependencies are defined at this stage.

---

## 2. Program Purpose

The purpose of this program is to:

> *[Describe in one or two plain-language sentences what the program exists to do and why it matters.]*

The program’s value should be understandable without reference to implementation details or technical architecture.

---

## 3. Primary Goals

The program is intended to achieve the following high-level goals:

* *[Goal 1: outcome-focused, not technical]*
* *[Goal 2]*
* *[Goal 3 (optional)]*

Goals describe **what success looks like**, not how it will be implemented.

---

## 4. Non-Goals (Explicit Exclusions)

The program explicitly will **not**:

* *[Non-goal 1]*
* *[Non-goal 2]*
* *[Non-goal 3 (if applicable)]*

These exclusions are binding and prevent scope creep during later phases.

---

## 5. Intended Users

The primary users of this program are:

* *[User type or role]*

Secondary or indirect users (if any):

* *[Optional]*

User descriptions should focus on **intent and interaction**, not UI or workflows.

---

## 6. Operational Context

At a high level, this program will operate in the following context:

* **Execution environment:**
  *[e.g., local application, web application, service, library, embedded, etc.]*

* **Interaction model:**
  *[e.g., human-driven, automated, mixed]*

* **Persistence:**
  *[e.g., no persistent state, local persistence, external storage — no schemas]*

These declarations constrain future architectural choices without defining them.

---

## 7. Constraints & Considerations

The following constraints or considerations apply to this program:

* *[Constraint: technical, legal, operational, or organizational]*
* *[Optional additional constraints]*

Constraints must be respected throughout all phases.

---

## 8. SCIS Compliance Statement

This program will be developed in strict accordance with SCIS rules, including:

* Maps-first design
* No implicit structure
* No implementation before declaration
* Deterministic, phase-locked progression

Any deviation must be explicitly documented and justified.

---

## 9. Next SCIS Step

The next file to be created for this program is:

> **A1p0s0f1 — Program File Map**

This file will define the **structural layout** of the program only.
It must be generated using the SCIS **Greenfield Map Rules** and must not introduce components, logic, or implementation details.
