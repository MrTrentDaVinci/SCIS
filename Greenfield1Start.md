## Title: **SCIS Greenfield Start**

**Phase:** P0
**Scope:** New Program (Greenfield)
**Status:** Authoritative Entry Point

---

## 1. Program Overview

This file marks the formal start of a new program developed using the SCIS framework.
The program is being designed from a greenfield state, meaning no existing code, architecture, or implementation is assumed.

All subsequent files, structures, and implementation decisions must derive from the intent, constraints, and declarations made here.
No code, components, logic, or dependencies are defined at this stage.

---

## 2. Program Purpose

The purpose of this program is to:

> *[Describe in one or two plain-language sentences what the program exists to do and why it matters.]*

The program’s value should be understandable without reference to implementation details, technical architecture, or internal mechanisms.

---

## 3. Problems & Desired Outcomes

### 3.1 Core Problems / Failure Modes

This program exists to address the following observable problems or failure modes:

* *[Problem 1: described as an observable behavior or systemic failure]*
* *[Problem 2]*
* *[Optional additional problems]*

Problems must be stated **without embedding solutions** or implied architectures.

### 3.2 Desired Outcomes / Capabilities

If successful, this program will enable the following outcomes:

* *[Outcome 1: what changes in the world for users or systems]*
* *[Outcome 2]*
* *[Optional additional outcomes]*

Outcomes describe **capabilities and effects**, not features or implementations.

---

## 4. Primary Goals

The program is intended to achieve the following high-level goals:

* *[Goal 1: outcome-focused, not technical]*
* *[Goal 2]*
* *[Goal 3 (optional)]*

Goals describe **what success looks like**, not how it will be implemented.

---

## 5. Non-Goals (Explicit Exclusions)

The program explicitly will **not**:

* *[Non-goal 1]*
* *[Non-goal 2]*
* *[Non-goal 3 (if applicable)]*

These exclusions are binding and prevent scope creep during later phases.

---

## 6. System Role & Interaction Flow

### 6.1 System Role

At a high level, this system’s role is to:

* *[Describe what the system sits between, coordinates, mediates, or enables]*

This defines the system’s **position in the larger environment**, not its internal structure.

### 6.2 High-Level Interaction Flow

The system’s abstract interaction or control flow can be described as:

> *[Input / Trigger → Transformation / Mediation → Output / Effect]*

This flow must remain **implementation-agnostic** and free of component detail.

---

## 7. Intended Users

The primary users of this program are:

* *[User type or role]*

Secondary or indirect users (if any):

* *[Optional]*

User descriptions should focus on **intent, expectations, and interaction**, not UI or workflows.

---

## 8. Core Domain Concepts

The program operates on the following core domain concepts:

* **[Concept Name]:** *[Brief, implementation-agnostic definition]*
* **[Concept Name]:** *[Definition]*

Where relevant, note relationships:

* *[Concept A references / composes / depends on Concept B]*

These concepts form the **shared vocabulary** for all subsequent SCIS maps and contracts.

---

## 9. State, Context, and Boundaries

### 9.1 State

For this program, “state” refers to:

* *[e.g., session state, world state, configuration, derived knowledge]*

Only the **existence and nature** of state may be declared here, not its structure.

### 9.2 Context Dependencies

The program depends on the following contextual factors:

* *[User context]*
* *[Environmental context]*
* *[Upstream or downstream systems (abstract)]*

### 9.3 Boundaries (In-Scope / Out-of-Scope)

The program:

* **Owns:** *[What it is responsible for]*
* **Observes:** *[What it reads or reacts to but does not control]*
* **Ignores:** *[What is explicitly out of scope]*

---

## 10. Operational Context

At a high level, this program will operate in the following context:

* **Execution environment:**
  *[e.g., local application, web application, service, library, embedded, etc.]*

* **Interaction model:**
  *[e.g., human-driven, automated, mixed]*

* **Persistence:**
  *[e.g., no persistent state, local persistence, external storage — no schemas]*

These declarations constrain future architectural choices without defining them.

---

## 11. Quality Attributes & Constraints

### 11.1 Quality Attributes (Prioritized)

The program prioritizes the following quality attributes:

* *[e.g., reliability, performance, scalability, safety, explainability, cost]*

If tradeoffs arise, these priorities guide decisions.

### 11.2 Cross-Cutting Constraints

The program is subject to the following non-functional constraints:

* *[e.g., cost ceilings, safety guarantees, privacy rules, reasoning opacity]*

These constraints apply across all components and phases.

---

## 12. Evolution, Metrics, and Learning

### 12.1 Signals & Measurements

The program will be evaluated using the following types of signals:

* *[Metrics, feedback, usage signals, outcome indicators]*

Specific dashboards or tools are not defined at this stage.

### 12.2 Allowed Adaptation

Measurements may influence the system through:

* *[Configuration changes]*
* *[Tuning or learning]*
* *[Deprecation or refinement of behaviors]*

Any adaptive behavior must remain within declared constraints.

---

## 13. Risks, Safeguards, and Scope Control

### 13.1 Foreseeable Risks

Potential risks or failure patterns include:

* *[Technical risk]*
* *[UX or operational risk]*
* *[Safety or misuse risk]*

### 13.2 Safeguards & Scope Limits

The following guardrails apply:

* *[Limits on automation, authority, data, or complexity]*
* *[Rules such as “do not build unless forced”]*

These rules are binding unless explicitly revised.

---

## 14. Integration & External Dependencies

The program is expected to integrate with or depend on:

* *[External systems, APIs, services, or resources — abstractly stated]*

Assumptions about these dependencies:

* *[Availability, latency, cost, trust level]*

No integration details or contracts are defined at P0.

---

## 15. SCIS Compliance Statement

This program will be developed in strict accordance with SCIS rules, including:

* Maps-first design
* No implicit structure
* No implementation before declaration
* Deterministic, phase-locked progression

Any deviation must be explicitly documented and justified.

---

## 16. Next SCIS Step

The next file to be created for this program is:

> **A1p0s0f1 — Program File Map**

This file will define the **structural layout** of the program only.
It must be generated using the SCIS **Greenfield Map Rules** and must not introduce components, logic, or implementation details.
